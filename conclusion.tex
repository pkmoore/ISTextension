\section{Conclusion}
\label{SEC:conclusion}

Many post-deployment failures result from unexpected interactions between
an application and its environment.  Although finding and eliminating
faults in applications is a key concern for software developers, it is
impractical for them to test an application in all of the environments in
which it will be deployed.  To address this problem, we introduced
CrashSimulator, a testing approach that utilizes mutation, replay, and
analysis of system call traces in order to determine whether an application
responds correctly to anomalous environmental conditions.  A significant
benefit of CrashSimulator is that failures observed in executing one
application in an anomalous environment can easily be leveraged to test
whether {\em other} applications suffer from the same underlying problem.

CrashSimulator's key features, operating on system calls and analysis of
replayed executions allow it to identify bugs resulting from an
application's interactions with its environment.  To test whether an
application responds appropriately to a particular anomaly (such as an
unexpected file type, an unexpected device, unexpected network conditions,
etc.) CrashSimulator records system call traces from the application under
test, mutates return values and/or program state to simulate execution in
the anomalous environment, and invokes a checker to see whether subsequent
system calls indicate a correct or incorrect response.  This allows
CrashSimulator to test an application running in one environment as if it
were running in another.

The tool evaluates application behavior in the (simulated) anomalous
environment by using finite state models to characterize correct (or
incorrect) behavior.  This provides a generic ``signature'' for that
behavior, which is portable across applications.  Consequently, a set of
mutations and checkers can be collected from any existing application for
use in testing other new or existing applications.  In this way, an
ever-expanding ``test suite'' can be created, allowing lessons learned from
bugs in one application to benefit many others.

Our evaluation of CrashSimulator has shown it to be both effective and
efficient.  CrashSimulator was able to identify bugs related to unusual
file types in 15 applications and bugs related to slow network performance
in 10 network applications and libraries.  Additionally CrashSimulator
found filesystem related bugs in 6 applications and libraries with
facilities for moving files within a system's filesystem.  The low overhead
introduced by CrashSimulator's technique meant that it was able to find
these bugs quickly in spite of its unoptimized implementation.

Future work will include expanding the repository of anomalies and their
checkers, as well as exploring opportunities to further automate the
discovery of anomalies and checkers.  In the long term, we envision a
public repository of anomalies along with CrashSimulator test patterns that
can be applied to new or existing applications.
