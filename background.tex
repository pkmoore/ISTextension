\section{what is an Environment?}
\label{SEC:background}

Before looking at how environments differ, it is important to clearly
define what an environment is.  An application's environment is the
collection of all resources external to the application with which the
application communicates.  These external resources can be thought of as
providing implicit inputs to the program that affect its flow of execution.

There are many examples of ways in which environments differ, even in
situations where they implement a ``standard interface'', such as Java or
POSIX.

\begin{itemize}

\item {\bf Operating Systems.}  A commonly observed difference is that many
applications behave in different ways due to the varying ways in which the
operating systems implement system calls.  For example, on Linux it is
possible to remove an open file while this is not allowed on Windows
systems~\cite{UnlinkStandard}.  An application written without this
difference in mind could fail should if it relies on one implementation or
the other.

\item {\bf File Systems.}  The exact file system used will also have a
substantial impact on the behavior of a system, independent of the
operating system.  The popular Ext4 file system on Linux is case sensitive,
so that ``a'' and ``A'' are different files, while OS X's HFS+ file system
is case insensitive so those file names would refer to the same file.
Different file systems have varying limits or behaviors for other items,
including file name length (popularized due to the 8.3 limitations of the
FAT file system), maximum file length, number of directory entries, depth
of directories supported, which leads to errors when programs are not
written to take these issues into account~\cite{EXT4Layout, AppleHFS}.

\item {\bf Network.}  Aspects of the network environment also have a
substantial impact on the behavior of application.  This can be either
local things or remote network behaviors.  For example, POSIX operating
systems support the notion of limiting the kernel buffer set aside for a
socket.  However, popular operating systems (Windows, Linux, and Mac)
implement this quite differently.  For example, in Linux, if a UDP datagram
larger than the specified buffer size is received it will be dropped.  In
Windows, however, UDP datagrams larger than the specified buffer size are
received but system calls that retrieve data from the buffer they are
stored in will only return a number of bytes less than or equal to the
buffer size at one time~\cite{Zhuang_NSDI_2014}.

\item {\bf Processor.}  The processor can also make a substantial
difference in the behavior of an application.  This is very frequently
evidenced through the variety of different floating point behaviors on
different processors~\cite{ArbitraryPrecision}.  However, this is not the
only difference.  Bugs in processors are fairly common and cause variance.
There are also intended differences that occur from varying interpretations
of how to execute complex instructions~\cite{Microarch}.

\end{itemize}

In this work, we focus on operating system, file system, and network
environmental issues which are the bulk of environmental issues that
applications struggle with today. Specifically, we are concerned with
issues from the above sources that are visible in the results and side
effects of the system calls an application makes.  We leave processor-based
environmental differences and differences not visible in system call
activity for future efforts.
