A common problem for developers
is applications exhibiting
new bugs \textit{after} deployment.
Many of these bugs
are caused by
unexpected network,
operating system,
and file system
differences that cause
program paths that were correct in a
development environment to fail once deployed.
Preventing these bugs is difficult because
it is impractical to test an application
in every environment.
Enter Simulation of Environmental Anomalies (SEA),
a technique that utilizes evidence
of one application’s failure
in a given environment
to generate tests
that can be applied to \textit{other} applications,
to see whether they suffer from analogous faults.
In SEA, models of unusual properties extracted
from interactions between an application $A$
and its environment guide simulations
of another application $B$ running
in the anomalous environment.
This reveals faults in how $B$ interacts
this environment without the expense of running in that environment.
Over time,
applications can be tested against
an increasing set of problematic conditions.
We implemented CrashSimulator using SEA
and evaluated it against a set of Linux applications
selected from Coreutils and the Debian popularity contest.
Our tests found a total of 65 bugs
in 24 applications
with effects including hangs,
crashes,
data loss,
and remote denial of service conditions.
